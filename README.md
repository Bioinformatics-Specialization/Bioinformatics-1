This [course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/dna-analysis?specialization=bioinformatics#about) begins a series of classes illustrating the power of computing in modern biology. Please join us on the frontier of bioinformatics to look for hidden messages in DNA without ever needing to put on a lab coat.

<h2>üß¨‚ÄÅDNA Replication</h2>
Where in the genome does DNA replication begin?  We will see that we can answer this question for many bacteria using only some straightforward algorithms to look for hidden messages in the genome.
<br><br>
<h2>üîé‚ÄÅThe Hidden Message</h2>
Which DNA patterns play the role of molecular clocks? The cells in your body manage to maintain a circadian rhythm, but how is this achieved on the level of DNA?  Once again, we will see that by knowing which hidden messages to look for, we can start to understand the amazingly complex language of DNA.  Perhaps surprisingly, we will apply randomized algorithms, which roll dice and flip coins in order to solve problems.
<br><br>
<h2>üå±‚ÄÅBiological Motifs</h2>
Get your hands dirty and apply existing software tools to find recurring biological motifs within genes that are responsible for helping Mycobacterium tuberculosis go "dormant" within a host for many years before causing an active infection.
